A Murderous Game of Guess Who

OVERVIEW:
You are a morally grey detective who uses racial profiling and tenuous policing methods to solve crime. Your objective is to solve a "who done it" case given a very limited
number of clues. You will use these clues along with some information provided on the suspects to guess who commit the crime. If your number of guesses exceeds those 
chosen in the game settings, you LOSE. If you are able to solve the crime, you are given a high score based on time taken and the number of guesses used. 

HOW TO PLAY:

When youre greated with the menu, you can go into the settings and choose different options for difficulty. The less clues given and the shorter the time control, the
more points will be awarded upon victory.

When you are ready to play, select the play button from the main menu.

When you select play, you will be greeted with a splash screen explaining the game to those who chose to not check the read-me. 

You will then meet your suspects. 20 images will be displayed along with the prior crimes, and some details about the suspects. 

You will then be pushed clues to use along with the suspect information to make guesses as to who commit the crime.

If your maximum number of guesses is reached, your game will end, and you will be taken back to the main menu.
